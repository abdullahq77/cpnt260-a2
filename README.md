## Struggles and obstacles
Struggled with getting the background image rounded with the clippy website. 
You could just overlap the background with the profile picture and give it a border. 
It was also tough to get around the padding for the icons and text. I guess the solution could be to give it a margin to level it out. 
Making the light vertical line above the icons was also an obstacle, but google has the answer. I did not put in a footer tag, instead I
added it in a ul tag. Had a hard time separating CSS, so I just grouped the similar declarations and spaced out the different ones.
